# Search-and-rescue-using-swarm

The algorithm is to rescue trapped hostages in destructed area. Five swarm robots were let into the field to explore and search the hostages. 
once any hostage is detected, that particular bot nearby will rotate 360 deg to record the video feed with current coordinates which is directly sent over a mesh network to the operator with an emergency signal. 
After rescue, bot will proceed to further exploration, else if completed it will return to origin.

In simulation attached, 

1. to run the simulation, use the stimulate mode
2. ignore the run time errors(as it is to show how the algorithm will behave if implemented on hardware)
3. then click on the play button.
